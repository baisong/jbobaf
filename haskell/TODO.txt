- Make sure that everything complies with (or at least is compatible with) the
  "BPFK Section: Formal Morphology" and "BPFK Section: PEG Morphology
  Algorithm" pages on the tiki!!!
- Add & implement Tamcux options for:
 - LAhOI
 - allowing commas between consonants
 - allowing commas between a consonant and a vowel
 - prohibiting commas between vowels
 - prohibiting commas in {fu'ivla} and {cmevla}
 - restricting consonant clusters in {fu'ivla} and {cmevla} (separate options)
   to have all consonant pairs after the first be initial
 - prohibiting rising diphthongs after a consonant (with an option for only
   prohibiting/allowing them in {cmavo}?)
 - prohibiting rising diphthongs in {fu'ivla}?
 - prohibiting {cmevla} that begin with non-initial consonant pairs
 - allowing {rafsi} of the form C[iu]V?
 - allowing {rafsi} containing Y's?
 - allowing {rafsi} containing syllables with empty onsets? (e.g., "ka,e")
 - replacing the 5-letter rule with a "{ma'osmi} rule"
- Add Haddock documentation for all of the exported functions
- Deal with {lujma'o} somehow
- Add functions to Valsi.hs for computing the component {rafsi}, source
  {tanru}, and {lujvo} score for {lujvo} & {lujvo cmene}.
- Add a rewrite rule (or whatever) that tells GHC that ``fadgau >>= fadgau ==
  fadgau''
- Make jvokatna able to split {lujvo cmene}
- Add a function for joining {rafsi} into {lujvo}
- Implement the remaining features for fadgau (including support for
  Allow_triphthongs and Split_bad_diphthongs)
