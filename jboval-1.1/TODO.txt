General:
 - Translate all of the documentation into Lojban (including the README)
 - Also bundle in the CGI scripts from my webpage?
 - Replace the Id keywords with $Format$ keywords.  Stupid Git.

sisku.pl:
 - Implement --help & --version messages
 - Idea: Instead of taking multiple operands on the command line which are
   searched for separately, make the command-line syntax more like that of
   `test` and allow specification of multiple conditions which must be matched
   in a given combination.  Or not.
 - Add a way to break {lujvo} apart and give the entries for the parts?

jvozba.pl:
 - Implement {lujvo} formation with "{zei}" for otherwise invalid words (i.e.,
   {cmavo} without {rafsi}, {cmene}, & {fu'ivla})
 - Handle {lujvo} given on the command line
 - Implement --help & --version output
 - Deal with the possibility of {cmene} containing {la}, {lai}, or {doi} being
   generated (at the very least, mention it in the documentation).

Lojban/Valsi.pm:
 - Store book code & frequency data for gimstecmi?
 - Lojbanize the rest of the method names?
 - Add a more general constructor
 - Add support for {lujvo}, {fu'ivla}, & {cmene}

Lojban/Vlasisku.pm:
 - Write a function/functions for getting words by both keyword and definition
 - Lojbanize all of the function names (rewrite getValsiByRafsi() to contain
   the term 'selraf'?)
 - Add a function for retrieving all {cmavo} in a given {selma'o}?
 - Write a function for fetching a random {gismu}, excluding {rafma'o}?
 - Write a function for fetching a random {valsi} ({gismu} or {cmavo}), ideally
   with even distribution?
 - Write a function for explicitly closing the filehandles?  (Don't export it
   by default.)

Lojban/Vlatai.pm:
 - Write a function for splitting a string of text into {valsi}
 - Write a function for determining whether a given string is a valid Lojban
   word
  - Write a regex for checking whether a consonant pair/cluster is valid or
    invalid
 - Write a function for determining whether a word is a compound {cmavo}
   (Should it be part of vlalei()?)
 - Handle uppercase letters
 - Handle {rafsi fu'ivla}?  (See CLL ยง4.16)
 - Rewrite vlalei() so that it rejects {lujvo} with superfluous hyphens and
   possibly so that it recognizes more invalid words and/or {fu'ivla}
 - Handle all currently undefined situations
 - Handle passing of Valsi objects
 - Add a jvozba() function?
