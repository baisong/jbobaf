VALSI.TSV FILE FORMAT

In place of the clunky formats of the official word lists, Jbobaf's valsi.tsv
file uses a single tab-separated format that accommodates all types of words
({gismu}, {cmavo}, {cmene}, etc.) and allows definitions of unlimited length,
among other benefits.  Each {valsi} is given by a single line containing one or
more tab-separated fields, which, in order, are:

 - {valsi} - the word itself (with no leading or trailing periods)
 - {selma'o}
 - {rafsi} - list of short {rafsi}, space-separated
 - {ralvla} - keyword or gloss
 - {djuvla} - hint
 - {selvla} - definition
 - {notci} - notes
 - {klesi} - word type ("gismu", "cmavo" (non-compound), "lujma'o" (compound
   {cmavo}), "lujvo", "fu'ivla", or "cmene"; all other values are ignored)

 [The following fields are only relevant to {lujvo} and {lujvo cmene}; for all
  other word types, they should be either left blank or omitted (assuming there
  are no other fields after them).]

 - {krarafsi} - the list of {rafsi} (in order, space-separated, and without
   hyphens) from which the {valsi} was formed
 - {veljvo} - the {tanru} from which the {valsi} was derived
 - {termre} - the {lujvo} score of the {valsi}

Unused, inapplicable, or simply undesirable fields are left empty (but must
still be separated from adjacent fields by a tab).  A series of empty fields at
the end of the line may be omitted.  Any extra fields are ignored but may be
used for new fields in the future.

When converting entries from the {lujvo} lists into this format, it is
recommended that the place structure descriptions be stored in the {selvla}
field, though the {notci} field is also acceptable.
